# Image_sorting_v1_with_cifar10
CIFAR-10 CNN Classifier with Tkinter GUI 🎨🖼️
This project is a deep learning-based image classifier trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch to classify images into 9 categories:
🚀 airplane | 🚗 automobile | 🐦 bird | 🐱 cat | 🦌 deer | 🐶 dog | 🐸 frog | 🐴 horse | 🚢 ship | 🚚 truck

Features 🔥
✅ CNN Model trained on CIFAR-10 for high accuracy
✅ Tkinter GUI for easy image classification
✅ Image Uploading to classify user-selected images
✅ Modern UI with a sleek color scheme

How to Use 🚀
1️⃣ Run cnn_train.py to train the model (or use the pre-trained model).
2️⃣ Start the Tkinter GUI with python gui.py.
3️⃣ Click Upload Image to select a photo and get its predicted class.
